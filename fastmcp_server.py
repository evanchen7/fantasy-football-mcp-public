VOLUME METRICS:
- Snap Count %: Percentage of offensive snaps played
  → 70%+ is ideal for RB/WR, 90%+ for elite
- Target Share: Percentage of team targets received
  → 20%+ is WR1 territory, 25%+ is elite
- Touch Count: Total rushing attempts + receptions
  → 15+ touches for RB1, 20+ is workhorse territory
- Red Zone Touches: Carries/targets inside opponent 20
  → High correlation with TDs and fantasy points
- Air Yards: Total depth of targets (catchable or not)
  → Higher air yards = more big play potential

EFFICIENCY METRICS:
- Yards Per Route Run (YPRR): Receiving yards per route
  → 2.0+ is excellent, 2.5+ is elite
- Yards After Contact (YAC): Rushing/receiving yards after contact
  → Indicates home run ability and toughness
- Yards Per Carry (YPC): Rushing efficiency
  → 4.5+ is good, 5.0+ is excellent
- True Catch Rate: Catchable targets caught
  → Better than raw catch % for WR evaluation
- Broken Tackles: Missed tackles forced
  → Indicates elusiveness and big play ability

SITUATION METRICS:
- Game Script: Expected point differential
  → Positive = more passing, Negative = more rushing
- Neutral Game Script %: Snaps in neutral situations
  → Better indicator of true role than blowouts
- Two-Minute Drill Usage: Involvement in hurry-up
  → Indicates trust and pass-catching ability
- Goal Line Carries: Touches inside 5-yard line
  → TD equity indicator for RBs

OPPORTUNITY METRICS:
- Expected Fantasy Points (xFP): Based on usage
  → Compare actual vs expected to find efficiency
- Opportunity Share: Team offense share
  → Volume is king in fantasy football
- Slot Rate: % of snaps in slot for WRs
  → Slot WRs see more targets in PPR
- Route Participation: % of pass plays running route
  → 90%+ indicates featured receiver

QUARTERBACK METRICS:
- Time to Throw: Average release time
  → Affects WR separation and completion %
- Play Action %: % of dropbacks using play action
  → Higher = more big plays downfield
- Pressure Rate: % of dropbacks under pressure
  → Affects turnovers and efficiency
- Deep Ball %: % of throws 20+ yards
  → Indicates downfield aggression

SKILL POSITION TRENDS:
- Trending Up: Increased snap %, target share, touches
- Trending Down: Decreased involvement or efficiency
- Consistent: Stable role week-to-week
- Volatile: Boom/bust performances

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
→ Volume > Talent in fantasy (especially early season)
→ Opportunity + Role > Efficiency alone
→ Target RBs with 15+ touches and WRs with 20%+ target share

ROSTER CONSTRUCTION FOR PLAYOFFS:
✓ Handcuff elite RBs (injury insurance)
✓ Drop low-floor bench players
✓ Prioritize favorable playoff schedules (Weeks 15-17)
✓ Stream defense matchups
✓ Have backup plans for every position
✓ Consolidate depth via trades before deadline
✓ Target players returning from injury

PRE-PLAYOFF PREPARATION (Weeks 12-14):
1. Analyze Week 15-17 schedules for all players
2. Identify teams likely to rest starters (Week 17)
3. Target defenses playing poor offenses in playoffs
4. Trade away future value for immediate upgrades
5. Prioritize players on pass-heavy offenses
6. Stock handcuffs for your RB1/RB2
7. Drop players on bye in Week 14

CHAMPIONSHIP WEEK STRATEGY (Week 16-17):
- Weather is critical (snow/wind affects passing)
- Monitor news for resting starters
- Indoor games safer than outdoor in December
- Volume over talent for borderline decisions
- Trust proven performers over hot waiver adds
- Have Saturday replacements for Sunday players
- Check Vegas lines (blowouts = less volume for studs)

PLAYOFF SCHEDULE ANALYSIS:
GOOD PLAYOFF MATCHUPS (Target):
- Bad pass defenses (allows 250+ pass yards/game)
- Bad run defenses (allows 130+ rush yards/game)
- High-scoring offenses (creates game script)
- Dome games in late December (weather-proof)
- Teams eliminated from playoffs (less effort)

BAD PLAYOFF MATCHUPS (Avoid):
- Elite defenses (top 5 in points allowed)
- Divisional revenge games (extra motivation)
- Cold weather games for warm weather teams
- Week 17 locked playoff seeds (rest risk)
- Backup QBs or depleted offenses

POSITIONAL STRATEGY:

QUARTERBACK:
- Target high-volume passers (35+ attempts)
- Prefer indoor or warm-weather games
- Avoid QBs on run-heavy teams in playoffs
- Stream based on matchup if no elite option

RUNNING BACK:
- Handcuff all workhorse RBs
- Target RBs with bellcow usage (20+ touches)
- Avoid RBBC situations in playoffs
- Monitor for rest in Week 17 for playoff teams
- Prefer pass-catching backs in PPR

WIDE RECEIVER:
- Target high-volume WRs (8+ targets)
- Slot receivers safer in bad weather
- Deep threats risky in wind/snow
- WR1s on team safer than WR2/3
- Avoid rookie QBs throwing in bad weather

TIGHT END:
- Elite TEs (Kelce tier) are matchup-proof
- Stream TEs against bad defenses otherwise
- Red zone usage critical for TE scoring
- Volume matters more than talent

FLEX DECISIONS:
- Prefer RBs over WRs in bad weather
- WRs have higher ceiling in good matchups
- TEs are floor plays (safe but low ceiling)
- Trust your studs over waiver wire adds
- Volume > Matchup for borderline decisions

DEFENSE/KICKER STREAMING:
- Stream defense vs bad offenses
- Target defenses at home in bad weather
- Kickers in domes for consistency
- Avoid defenses vs elite QBs

WEEK 17 CONSIDERATIONS:
⚠️ Teams with locked playoff seeds may rest starters
⚠️ Monitor Saturday injury reports closely
⚠️ Have backup plans for every starter
⚠️ Avoid players on locked 1-seed teams
⚠️ Target teams fighting for playoff spots

CHAMPIONSHIP MENTALITY:
💪 Trust the players who got you here
💪 Don't overthink lineup decisions
💪 Weather and game script matter most
💪 Volume and opportunity = floor
💪 Have contingency plans ready
💪 Championship = bold moves + smart process"""

def get_dynasty_keeper_guide() -> str:
    """Provide strategies for dynasty and keeper leagues."""
    return """Dynasty & Keeper League Strategy Guide:

DYNASTY LEAGUE FUNDAMENTALS:
- Player values span multiple years
- Youth and upside trump proven veterans
- Draft picks are valuable trade assets
- Rebuild vs compete decisions critical
- Contracts and cap space management (if applicable)
- Deeper benches (25-30+ roster spots typical)

KEEPER LEAGUE FUNDAMENTALS:
- Keep 1-5 players year-to-year (league dependent)
- Keeper cost tied to draft position or auction $
- Balance current year vs future value
- Late-round picks provide keeper value
- Drop players with bad keeper value late season

VALUATION DIFFERENCES (Dynasty vs Redraft):

POSITIONS TO PRIORITIZE:
1. Elite Young RBs (age 22-25)
   → Rare asset with multi-year value
2. Young WRs with target share (age 22-27)
   → Longer careers than RBs, safer dynasty assets
3. Young elite TEs (age 23-26)
   → Kelce/Andrews tier, decade-long value
4. Top 5 QBs in Superflex
   → Game-breaking advantage in Superflex formats

ROOKIE DRAFT STRATEGY:
- Early picks = high-capital NFL draft picks
- Target landing spot + draft capital combination
- RBs have shorter shelf life but immediate impact
- WRs take 2-3 years to develop typically
- QBs in Superflex leagues = premium value
- Avoid reaching for need (value > need in dynasty)

PLAYER LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:

CONTENDING TEAMS (Win Now):
→ Trade future picks for proven vets
→ Target players aged 26-29 (prime years)
→ Package young players for upgrades
→ Stream and optimize for current season
→ Don't hold onto taxi squad guys

REBUILDING TEAMS (2+ Years Out):
→ Trade aging vets for picks
→ Acquire young players with upside
→ Take on injured players for discount
→ Don't compete half-way (commit to rebuild)
→ Accumulate draft capital (1sts and 2nds)

AGING CURVE BY POSITION:
- RB: Peak age 24-27, cliff at 28-30
- WR: Peak age 25-29, productive to 32+
- TE: Peak age 25-30, productive to 33+
- QB: Peak age 27-35, can play to 40+

TRADE STRATEGY:

SELLING WINDOW (Trade Before Value Drops):
- RBs aged 28+ (especially with injuries)
- WRs aged 31+ (target win-now teams)
- Players on contract years (uncertainty)
- Boom/bust players after hot streak
- Backup RBs before starter returns

BUYING WINDOW (Acquire at Discount):
- Injured players from contenders
- Rookies after slow start (patience pays)
- Players in bad offenses (situation change)
- Young WRs breaking out (buy early)
- Players on new teams (positive change)

DRAFT PICK VALUES:
- 1st Round Picks: Premium assets (especially early)
- 2nd Round Picks: Solid value, trade fodder
- 3rd+ Round Picks: Dart throws, low hit rate

TYPICAL PICK VALUE (Dynasty):
- Early 1st (1.01-1.03): Established WR2/RB2
- Mid 1st (1.04-1.08): Young WR2 or aging RB1
- Late 1st (1.09-1.12): WR3 with upside or TE1
- Early 2nd: High-upside WR or backup RB
- Mid/Late 2nd: Bench depth or taxi squad stash

KEEPER LEAGUE SPECIFIC:

KEEPER VALUE CALCULATION:
- Keep cost vs Expected draft position
- Years of keeper eligibility remaining
- Contract escalation (if applicable)
- Opportunity cost of keeper slot

BEST KEEPER VALUES:
✓ Late round picks who broke out (round 10+ keepers)
✓ Rookies drafted late who hit (league-winning value)
✓ Injured players stashed (return to form)
✓ Young QBs in Superflex (early breakouts)

AVOID KEEPING:
✗ Early round picks (no value gain)
✗ Aging RBs (value cliff coming)
✗ Players with bad contracts (auction leagues)
✗ Injury-prone vets (risk > reward)

KEY DIFFERENCES VS REDRAFT:
📊 Think 2-3 years ahead, not just this season
📊 Age matters more than current production
📊 Target situation + talent over production only
📊 Rebuild fully or compete fully (no half-measures)
📊 Draft picks are tradeable assets with real value
📊 Patience is rewarded (develop young players)
📊 Deeper benches = more roster management"""
